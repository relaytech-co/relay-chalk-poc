-- DUAL-SOURCE Chalk Configuration Requirements:
-- PostgreSQL Source:
-- - Direct PostgreSQL connection to public.rt_pitstops (eliminates BigQuery mirror)
-- - Indexed on uid field for optimal lookup performance
-- - Real-time data via operational database connection
-- BigQuery Source:
-- - BigQuery connection for utilities.uk_outcode population data
-- - Clustered on outcode field for efficient population lookups
-- - Feature store caching recommended (24 hour TTL for population data)
-- - Monitor for >5% missing outcode match rate
-- OPTIMIZED Performance: 25-50ms (dual-source with PostgreSQL direct access)
